    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Kelvin!</strong> By day, I am a software engineer.</p>
    <p>By night (and also during the day, and also on the weekends, basically whenever I'm not sleeping), I am a husband and father of 2.</p>

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>Since graduating from a coding bootcamp, I've spent my career doing mostly making web applications with Ruby on Rails at various startups. I currently work at <a href="https://www.mudflapinc.com">Mudflap</a>.</p>
    <p>While I've mostly focused on backend in my career and I quite enjoy working with both Ruby and Rails, I'm comfortable across the full stack and am interested in branching out to other languages and frameworks.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>I like games! I grew up playing video games, and Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo GameCube has a special place in my heart. I also enjoy board games, though mostly play those digitially as well nowadays.</p>
    <p>I like to stay active. I played sports in middle/high school, and now I enjoy swimming, weightlifting, badminton, and chasing my kids around the park.</p>

    
    <h2>What's in a username?</h2>
    <p>-272° C ≈ 1 K</p>
    <p>"m272cels" is short for "Minus 272 Celsius". If you've taken a chemistry class, you may know that this is nearly absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature in the universe, which is -273.15° C.</p>
    <p>A useful alternative to Celsius when talking about very cold temperatures is the Kelvin scale, which is essentially Celsius with an offset such that absolute zero is 0 Kelvin.</p>
    <p>Thus, -272° Celsius is roughly equal to 1 Kelvin.</p>
    <i>(Yes, I am aware that I'm a nerd.)</i>
